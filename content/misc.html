      Our Chemistry teacher told our class there was going to be a fire drill. 
      Only our class (Chemistry Class) knew, so 
      I told my friends who were taking other classes that I was going to ring the fire alarm and 
      they dared my to do it and bet money on it. 
      Eventually the drill began and they believed I actually did it. 
      Also I got the money.
