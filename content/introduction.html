<h1> About the School </h1>
<p class="full">
  Singapore International School @ Gamuda Gardens is a modern, well-maintained international school campus
  located in Hoang Mai District, Hanoi. Accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), 
  SIS@GG provides a well-rounded education from Pre-Nursary to Year 12 students (THAT'S US!)
  <br/><br/>
  Throughout high school, the graduating class of 2022 successfully completed 8 semesters or 16 terms of school, 
  writing the IGCSE, AS and A Level exams provided by Cambridge Assessment International Education. 
  This profile attempts to showcase who SIS @ GG 2022 students are, what they've done, and how they experienced 
  high school.
  <br /><br />
  This profile is not affiliated with Singapore International School or KinderWorld International Group in any way.

<h1> Preface </h1>

<p class="full">
The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
In total, 36 out of 37 (97%) graduating students responded. 
<br /><br />


Being the largest graduating class of SIS in history of the school, classes and experiences can vary significantly 
from year to year. High school is what you make of it. 
<br /><br />

Study terms are defined as IG1, IG2, AS, and AL. Government shutdowns due to Covid-19 began in Febuary 2020, halfway 
through IG2. IG2 exams were cancelled due to it, and all students received a predicted grade which became their final
grades for their subjects.

<br /><br />

Although we went back to school in the beginning of AS Level, schools closed down again 1 day before the Cambridge
Exams began. Exams were still allowed to take place, and most students took the AS Level exam in-person. 

Due to prolonged shutdowns, most of our A Level learnings took place online, which inevitably reduced the quality
of learning, our motivation, and opportunities to thrive as a Senior. We finally went back to school in Febuary 2022, 
and wrote our final A Level papers. 


<br /><br />
The content of this class profile was inspired by the many University class profiles around the world
 that preceded it, with the presentation being a variation of the
<a href="https://classprofile.andyzhang.net/" target="_blank">
  2018 UW created by Andy Zhang
</a>.
It is our hope that the groundwork set by Andy & others will be iterated on by
future classes, as we did, in order to take future profiles to new heights.
