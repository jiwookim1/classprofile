The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey
done through Google Forms. 
In total, 36 out of 37 (97%) graduating students responded. 
<br /><br />


Being the largest graduating class of SIS ever,
this year's class may have gone through a different experience than past 
graduating classes. Experiences will vary significantly from year to year. 
<br /><br />

Study terms are defined as IG1, IG2, AS, and AL. Government shutdowns due to Covid-19 began in Febuary 2020, halfway 
through IG2. IG2 exams were cancelled due to it, and all students received a predicted grade which became their final
grades for their subjects.

Although we went back to school in the beginning of AS Level, schools closed down again 1 day before the Cambridge
Exams began. Exams were still allowed to take place, and most students took the AS Level exam in-person. 

Due to prolonged shutdowns, most of our A Level learnings took place online, which inevitably reduced the quality
of learning, our motivation, and opportunities to thrive as a Senior. We finally went back to school in Febuary 2022, 
and wrote our final A Level papers.
