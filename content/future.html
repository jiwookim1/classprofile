<h3> High School Rating </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    72.2% of students gave the SIS high school experience a 7 out of 10 or more.
  </span>
  Whether it was the quality of education or friends that supported their journey, 
  SIS students had an overall positive experience at the school.
  <br></br>
  While students had numerous complaints about the school, this proves that 
  other factors are more important to having a positive experience. School is what you make
  of it.

    "What is a piece of advice you would give to your IG1 self?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Everyone's timeline is different so don't compare yourself to others.
    <br></br>
    Try everything, even if it's not allowed. Rather look 
    back with memories than living with regrets. Also 
    worry less. Enjoy all the time you spend with friends.
    <br></br>
    Exercise more, even some basic regimes are fine
    <br></br>
    Stick with sports and not esports
    <br></br>
    Cherish the time you have with your friends
    <br></br>
    You donâ€™t have to impress everyone
    <br></br>
    Just take guitar lessons and do what you wanted. You do have time and I 
    can promise you that you should use this time to study art from scratch.  
    <br></br>
    Just keep up what you are doing now. Dont try to live so wise cause you 
    are so right
    <br></br>
    Dont try to flirt yet cuz you look like a primary kid
    <br></br>
    Stop tryna impress girls and work on yourself. Also dont play league of 
    legends
    <br></br>
    Enjoy the moment
    <br></br>
    Stay don't leave just stay
    <br></br>
    Wake up please.

    "What is the best lesson you learned in high school?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Surround yourself with good people
    <br></br>
    You simply don't have time to balance work and sleep if you want to build your dreams, so 
    sleep less. Sleep is overrated.
    <br></br>
    Enjoy every moment at school. Emphasis on the word "every".
    <br></br>
    Donâ€™t think with your [redacted]
    <br></br>
    Studying overnight is not worth it
    <br></br>
    Enjoy every moment while it lasts because you won't get to experience them again
    <br></br>
    Understanding my own needs is better than following others
    <br></br>
    Most of the things i worry about never happens
    <br></br>
    Not all adults are "Adults"    <br></br>
    Do everything yourself, don't rely on anyone cause they won't be there all the time to babysit you    
    <br></br>
    Academic validation, your grades and the university you get/didnâ€™t get into DOES NOT define 
    your identity and it certainly does not determine your value. You are more than a test store 
    and you are worthy of everything you desire no matter what you think.
