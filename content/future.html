<h3> High School Rating </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    72.2% of students gave the SIS high school experience a 7 out of 10 or more.
  </span>
  Whether it was the quality of education or friends that supported their journey, 
  SIS students had an overall positive experience at the school.
  <br></br>
  While students still have numerous complaints about the school, this proves that 
  other factors are more important to having a positive experience. School is what you make
  of it.

    Students do not feel the need to become accredited as Professional Engineers.
  </span>
  Most students have no intention to pursue a license with the PEO. This is
  required to have your job title include the term "Engineer" within Canada.
  Very few industries restrict hiring to accredited engineers and instead employ
  "software developers".

<h3> Full-Time Compensation </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    The compensation for the first year of full-time work for respondents
    will average $284,728 CAD, with a median of $260,000. This number
    includes all forms of remuneration eg. signing bonuses and equity.
  </span>
  The exchange rate used for this question and the ones that follow was 1.3
  CAD per 1 USD. That rate was accurate at the time the survey was shared,
  but the rate is 1.2 as of writing.
  <br /><br />
  Since 77% of respondents will be relocating to the US, we can estimate
  the new average and median earnings to actually be $267,882 and $244,600 CAD.
   260k*(1 + 0.77(1.2/1.3 - 1)).

    The hourly wage / salary will have an average and a median of $105 and

  We can again estimate this to be $99 and $76 CAD with today's exchange rate.

    There's a huge discrepancy in profit sharing for new grads,
    with the average and median being $95,392 and $32,500 CAD.
  </span>
  "Profit sharing" here is used to encompass stock options, RSUs,
  and other forms of equity-based compensation.
  <br /><br />
  There are extreme outliers that skewed the mean and median greatly.
  <br /><br />
  With the new exchange rate, the results are $89,742 and $30,505 CAD.

    Signing bonuses were common for respondents, with the average and

  </span>
  The modal response was $0 for a signing bonus with 15 responses out of
  the total 47.
  <br /><br />
  Adjusting for the new exchange rate, we find the average and median to be 
  $59,248 and $37,630 CAD.

<h3> Motivations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    An enjoyable workplace and a good compensation were the biggest factors in
    accepting full-time roles. 
  </span>
  It is great to see the class value a positive environment above compensation.
  <br /><br />
  In contrast to most other industries, software recruitment has remained
  relatively unaffected in the face of a global pandemic. Only 1 respondent factored
  job security in their decision-making.

<h3> Moving home </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    27% of respondents plan to return to their home country after having moved away.
  </span>
  Moving away is a big change. There's a fairly even split among students who would like to return home or stay abroad, while the rest of students haven't decided yet.
  This goes to show that everyone has different goals and each student should find what's important to them.
  <br/><br/>
  One common tip from alumni is to pursue what makes you happy and aligns with your values.
  This way, you can find the most happiness in what you do, whether that's close to home or abroad.

<h3> Closing Remarks </h3>
<p class="full">
  The following is a summary of the advice shared by students. 
  Many of the sentences
  are directly quoted or rephrased from the original advice.

  <div class="vb"></div>
  <span class="big">
    "What is a piece of advice you would give to your IG1 self?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Everyone's timeline is different so don't compare yourself to others.
    <br></br>
    Try everything, even if it's not allowed. Rather look 
    back with memories than living with regrets. Also 
    worry less. Enjoy all the time you spend with friends.
    <br></br>
    Exercise more, even some basic regimes are fine
    <br></br>
    Stick with sports and not esports
    <br></br>
    Cherish the time you have with your friends
    <br></br>
    you don’t have to impress everyone
    <br></br>
    Just take guitar lessons and do what you wanted. You do have time and I 
    can promise you that you should use this time to study art from scratch.  
    <br></br>
    Just keep up what you are doing now. Dont try to live so wise cause you 
    are so right
    <br></br>
    Dont try to flirt yet cuz you look like a primary kid
    <br></br>
    Stop tryna impress girls and work on yourself. Also dont play league of 
    legends
    <br></br>
    Enjoy the moment
    <br></br>
    Stay don't leave just stay
    <br></br>
    Wake up please.

    "What is the best lesson you learned in high school?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    Surround yourself with good people
    <br></br>
    You simply don't have time to balance work and sleep if you want to build your dreams, so 
    sleep less. Sleep is overrated.
    <br></br>
    Enjoy every moment at school. Emphasis on the word "every".
    <br></br>
    Don’t think with your dick
    <br></br>
    Studying overnight is not worth it
    <br></br>
    Enjoy every moment while it lasts because you won't get to experience them again
    <br></br>
    understanding my own needs is better than following others
    <br></br>
    most of the things i worry about never happens
    <br></br>
    Not all adults are "Adults"    <br></br>
    Do everything yourself, don't rely on anyone cause they won't be there all the time to babysit you    
    <br></br>
    Academic validation, your grades and the university you get/didn’t get into DOES NOT define 
    your identity and it certainly does not determine your value. You are more than a test store 
    and you are worthy of everything you desire no matter what you think.
