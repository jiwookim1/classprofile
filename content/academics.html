  Over the 4 years, the class average fluctuated slightly.
  </span>
  We notice that IG2 and A Level averages were higher than the year prior to them. One likely
  cause is the transition to online classes in those years. Similar to all education systems 
  around the world, SIS was affected by grade inflation. 
  <br /><br />
  This can further be seen in the graph above. The proportion of students who had and A or above was 
  significantly higher in IG2 and A Levels, the two years that was affected by Covid-19. 
  It is also interesting to see that IG1 was statistically the most difficult year. This may be because 
  of the change to the Cambridge International curriculum. Students had been studying the Singaporean 
  curriculum prior to IG1.

  <span class="small" style="margin-left:30px;">This was calculated by converting A* to 95%, A to 85%, etc. 
    This is not an accurate representation of the true mean values.

<h3>Failures</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  31% of respondents said they failed a subject. 3 students preferred not to disclose. 
  </span>
  Failures, however, were a minor setback. At least 92% of students had a passing predicted grade
  for their A-Level final exams.

<h3>Favorite Teachers</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The most favorited teacher with 17% of the votes is Mr. Tamir Ratzon.
  </span>
  Dr. Donald Reedy came in a close second. 
  <br /><br />
  There was a wide range of teachers chosen by the students. One thing we can say is
  that the person who chose this year's A-Level form teachers did a great job.

<h2> Classes </h2>
<h3> Favorite classes </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Business Studies was by far the most favored class.
</span>
  One thing to note is that three students voted PE as their favorite class. It might be a good 
  idea to bring PE classes to those who want it in AS and A Levels.
