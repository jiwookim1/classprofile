  Over the 4 years, the class average fluctuated slightly.
  </span>
  We notice that IG2 and A Level averages were higher than the year prior to them. One likely
  cause is the transition to online classes in those years. Similar to all education systems 
  around the world, SIS was affected by grade inflation. 
  <br /><br />
  This can further be seen in the graph above. The proportion of students who had and A or above was 
  significantly higher in IG2 and A Levels, the two years that was affected by Covid-19. 
  It is also interesting to see that IG1 was statistically the most difficult year. This may be because 
  of the change to the Cambridge International curriculum. Students had been studying the Singaporean 
  curriculum prior to IG1.

<h3>Failures</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  31% of respondents said they failed a subject. 3 students preferred not to disclose. 
  </span>
  Failures, however, were a minor setback. At least 92% of students had a passing predicted grade
  for their A-Level final exams.

<h3>Favourite Teachers</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The most favourited teacher with 17% of the votes is Mr. Tamir Ratzon.
  </span>
  Dr. Donald Reedy came in a close second. 
  <br /><br />
  There was a wide range of teachers chosen by the students. One thing we can say is
  that the person who chose this year's A-Level form teachers did a great job.

<h2> Classes </h2>
<h3> Favourite classes </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Business Studies was by far the most favoured class.
  <!-- Although 3B was the most difficult term, it had Concurrency (CS343), the most popular course. -->
</span>
  One thing to note is that three students voted PE as their favourite class. It might be a good 
  idea to bring PE classes to those who want it in AS and A Levels.

<h3> Least favourite required courses </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se463" target="_blank">SE 463 (Software Requirements Specification and Analysis)</a>, 
    <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece106" target="_blank">ECE 106 (Electricity and Magnetism)</a>
    and <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se380" target="_blank">SE 380 (Introduction to Feedback Control)</a> were the most disliked core courses.
  </span>
  Some Linkage Electives were also not liked among the class such as SMF 101, SPCOM 100, and SPCOM 223.
  <br></br>
  It's important to note that courses that were disliked do not imply that
  respondents find the content useless. Instead, a variety of factors, such as
  personal interests, final grades, and workload, may have come into play.
  For example, Operating Systems (SE 350) is considered useful by 96% of students
  <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se350" target="_blank">
    according to UWFlow</a>, despite being nominated as a least favourite course.

<h2> Overloading </h2>
<h3>Overloading & Academic Terms</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Overloading is popular among the class with 28 respondents (53%) overloading
  at some point during their academic degree.
  </span>
  The 3A and 4A terms are the most popular ones to overload. The SE curriculum encourages
  students to overload in their 4A term to have a lighter term in 4B, which can be busy
  with graduation traditions and FYDP work on top of courses.

<h3>Overloading Reasons</h3>

  The most popular reasons to overload were to have a lighter term and to

<h3>Post-Covid</h3>

  When COVID hit, most respondents still decided to move back to Waterloo in their 4A term.

  student housing already rented for the year.
  However, in 4B, most respondents decided to move back home.

  beneficial to students, instead, it suggests that Enriched Program do not give an evident advantage in comparison
