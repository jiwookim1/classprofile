<h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">Over 80% of respondents felt imposter syndrome over their university years.</span>
  Impostor syndrome refers to an individual's internal experience of believing that they are not as competent as others perceive them to be. 
  The Software Engineering program is very competitive and has one of the highest admission averages in Waterloo. This can place students in a 
  pressure-to-achieve environment which might have led to students feeling like an imposter.
</p>
<div class="half second">
  <span class="graph-title">did you feel like an imposter?</span>
  <div id="imposter-syndrome" class="graph-center"></div>
</div>
<p class="half">
  By the end of their university career, around 46% of respondents do not feel imposter syndrome, while 30% of the respondents sometimes do, and 24% of the 
  respondents still do. This shows a growth in the respondents' confidence over the years as they overcame their academic hurdles, experienced the real world
  during co-ops, and found their calling in Software Engineering.
