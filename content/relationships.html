<h3>What is your view on relationships?</h3>
<p class="quote">
  Have fun, don't cheat. Stop counting days just enjoy the ride.
  <br /><br />
  Should be encouraged, should not be stigmatised.
  <br /><br />
  Good for mental health and happiness, but can be stressful, can be expensive, can distract people from their studies

  while you're young don't ever fall in love, its fake
  <br /><br />
  Overrated/Don't care enough
  <br /><br />
  There are many forms of relationship and you and your partner(s) don’t have to conform to the norm if you don’t want to. Basically, relationships aren’t black and white.
  <br /><br />
  Nothing last forever
  <br /><br />
  boys are immature
  <br /><br />
  Ah yojachingu saguigoshipda
  <br /><br />
  If you find the right one, it will last
  <br /><br />
  Having one is nice but not having one doesnt matter
  <br /><br />
  relationships could make me more mature
  <br /><br />
  It's something worth experiencing ig, setting all the bad memories aside
  <br /><br />
  It’s fine to have relationships, honestly it’s quite an interesting experience, you get hit with all sorts of new feelings. But you must know your priorities. Once those priorities are finished, do whatever you want.
