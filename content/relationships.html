<h3>The most touching thing that a classmate has done for me was...</h3>
<p class="quote">
  Doing classwork for me when I was playing games during online class.

<h3>What is your view on relationships?</h3>
<p class="quote">
  Have fun, don't cheat. Stop counting days just enjoy the ride.
  <br /><br />
  Should be encouraged, should not be stigmatised.
  <br /><br />
  Good for mental health and happiness, but can be stressful, can be expensive, can distract people from their studies
  <br /><br />
  while you're young don't ever fall in love, its fake
  <br /><br />
  Overrated/Don't care enough
  <br /><br />
  There are many forms of relationship and you and your partner(s) don’t have to conform to the norm if you don’t want to. Basically, relationships aren’t black and white.
  <br /><br />
  Nothing last forever
  <br /><br />
  boys are immature
  <br /><br />
  Ah yojachingu saguigoshipda
  <br /><br />
  If you find the right one, it will last
  <br /><br />
  Having one is nice but not having one doesnt matter
  <br /><br />
  relationships could make me more mature
  <br /><br />
  It's something worth experiencing ig, setting all the bad memories aside
  <br /><br />
  It’s fine to have relationships, honestly it’s quite an interesting experience, you get hit with all sorts of new feelings. But you must know your priorities. Once those priorities are finished, do whatever you want.

    "How has your understanding of relationships changed
    in the past 5 years?"
  </span>
  <p class="quote">
    The people who we cared most about in our lives who we
    have parted ways with are not gone. They exist as memories,
    as voices of our consciences, and as layers of the characters
    we are today.
    <br></br>
    Understanding compromise.
    <br></br>
    Yes.
    <br></br>
    They take time to nurture and maintain. That's not
    meant to sound overly pessimistic, but if you have a
    busy schedule, you need to think consciously about the
    relationships you want to keep and those you don't to
    have a happy social life.
    <br></br>
    The USD, which bases on the American economy, is more
    stable than most relationships.
    <br></br>
    People are like plants: some need more water, others
    less, and watering them is your responsibility. Maybe
    this plant needs more than you can give, maybe that
    one you like less; ultimately you decide who you want
    to keep in your life and water that relationship.
    <br></br>
    I've learned more to love in my own way, instead of
    mimicking the relationship of my parents. 
    <br></br>
    Oh so completely different with my parents and family.
    Treated completely like an adult and I swear I've been
    helping parent my little brother.
